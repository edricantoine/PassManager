# Password Manager

## By Edric Antoine


This application provides a convenient way to store usernames and passwords for sites you visit. It will include 
functionality such as being able to *search* for a specific website, as well as *add, modify, and remove* entries in the
password manager. This application could be useful to anyone who browses the Internet frequently, or has trouble 
remembering usernames and passwords.

This project is of interest to me since I have always had trouble keeping my passwords and usernames in one place, which
has caused me much more inconvenience than necessary in certain situations. I believe that this application will help
myself and others like me to be more organized.
